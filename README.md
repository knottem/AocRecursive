# AocRecursive

This is a school project for solving 5 Advent of Code puzzles on your own first and then with the help of other kotlin solutions to the puzzles and implementing a recursive algorithm for a custom problem.

## Advent Of Code Puzzle

This project includes solutions to the following Advent of Code puzzles:

1.  [Day 1: Calorie Counting (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
2.  [Day 4: Passport Processing (2020)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)
3.  [Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? (2015)](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)
4.  [Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)
5.  [Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab (2016)](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1)
6.  [Day 4: Secure Container (2019)](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)<br />

Each puzzle solution is located in a separate package.

## Recursive Algorithm

In addition to the Advent of Code puzzles, this project also includes an implementation of a recursive algorithm for a custom problem. 
The problem is described in detail in the Tomte.kt file, along with the implementation of the recursive algorithm. 
There are also old versions of my recursive algorithm in the Tomte.kt file, which I used in the beginning.

## Running the project

There are tests for each puzzle solution and the recursive algorithm tests that can be found in the test folder.
