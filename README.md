# AocRecursive

This is a school project for solving 5 Advent of Code puzzles on your own first and then with the help of other kotlin solutions to the puzzles and implementing a recursive algorithm for a custom problem.

## Advent Of Code Puzzle

This project includes solutions to the following Advent of Code puzzles:

1.  [Day 1: Calorie Counting (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
2.  [Day 4: Passport Processing (2020)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)
3.  [Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? (2015)](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)
4.  [Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)
5.  [Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab(2016)](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1)<br />

Each puzzle solution is implemented in a separate module.

## Recursive Algorithm

In addition to the Advent of Code puzzles, this project also includes an implementation of a recursive algorithm for a custom problem. 
The problem is described in detail in the Tomte.kt file, along with the implementation of the recursive algorithm.

## Running the project

There are tests for each puzzle solution and the recursive algorithm that can be found in the test folder.
